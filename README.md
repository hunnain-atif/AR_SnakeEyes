# AR_SnakeEyes

## General Information

This iteration incorporates the ARKit framework to allow the user to roll dice on a real surface in front of them. When the user taps
on the surface a dice appears (the user can add as many dice as they like). Then when the user shakes their device the all the dice
animate to simulate a roll and then stop at a random side.
